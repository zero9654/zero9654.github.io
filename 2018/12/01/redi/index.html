  <p>In this project, as a team, we applied different user-centered methods to investigate the customer scene. We chose REDI because it is the newest shopping mall in the Helsinki area.</p>
<p>Before the project start, we also get the pemission of doing investigation there. The manager also indicated that there were plenty of ‘navigation’ problems inside the shopping mall, which customers have complained a lot. Because of this, we were more problem-oriented when conducting the investigation. We stay focus on navigating to bus stops.</p>
<p>Since I have never been that shopping mall, I first shot a video of navigating myself to the west bus stop with the think aloud protocol. As a novelty, I lost my way and failed to find the bus stop and had no idea where I was. I was completely confused by these guidance signs. They directed me to a place of nowhere. All these obstacles were marked down for the following investigation, which was especailly useful to forming our questions for interviewing.</p>
<p>With team, we started going around inside the building and obeserving customers. It was quite obvious that there were a lot of customers wandering around to find their way, some were even upset. </p>
<p>Then we randomly interviewed several passengers to get insights from them. Seven out of fourteen (7/14) were first time at REDI as well because of the ‘reputation’ of REDI. They were curious. Some cusomters were disappointed and expressed very negative feelings about failing finding their way. Few customers were satisfied with REDI since it is new and not much people there. Besides, we also interviewed the info desk and four staff. According to their knowledge and own experience, most of staff there commute by metro, so none of these staff we interviewed has any idea of the bus stop location.</p>
<p>Now, we have a lot of data from obeservation, field study, and interviews. To sort out data, we categorised data as an affinity diagram.</p>
<p><img src="/images/use_this_1.jpg" alt="Affinity" style="height: 500px; width: 100px "><br><img src="/images/use_this_2.jpg" alt="Affinity2" style="height: 500px; width: 100px "><br><img src="/images/use_this_3.jpg" alt="Affinity3" style="height: 500px; width: 100px "></p>
<p><img src="/images/affinity1.jpg" alt="Affinity Map" style="height: 500px; width: 500px "><br><img src="/images/affinity2.jpg" alt="Affinity Map" style="height: 500px; width: 500px "><br><img src="/images/affinity3.jpg" alt="Affinity Map" style="height: 500px; width: 500px "><br><img src="/images/affinity4.jpg" alt="Affinity Map" style="height: 500px; width: 500px "></p>
<p>Based on our interviewees, we categorised four typical user groups for further study.</p>
<p>We found out that the task-oriented customer suffered from indoor navigation problem the most. Thus, we created a customer journey map to visualize each touch point along with the changing emotions to find out the key pain point. </p>

<p><img src="/images/journeymap.jpg" alt="Journey Map" style="height: 1000px; width: 800px "></p>
<p>All in all, the key challenges we found were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigation. Customers get lost quite easily, this has impacted the reputation of REDI.</li>
<li>Bus stop design. Both stops lack cover from either rain or nosie.</li>
<li>Redi service point. A lof of info screens, but there is only one info desk. What’s more, there is no clear sign directing customers to the info desk.</li>
</ol>
<p>What we recommend to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>For navigation, we suggest to apply distinguishable light and decorations at different parts of REDI.</li>
<li>For bus stops, we suggest to increase the coverage by installing rain covers and noise proof barriers.</li>
<li>For ambiguous signs, we suggest all signs should follow the same logic and deploy these signs properly(not too much but at key area).</li>
</ol>
