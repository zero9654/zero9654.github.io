Currently, I am actively looking for an internship as a UX/UI designer.</p>\n<p>Design:<br>User Research · Persona · Scenario · Affinity Map · User Journey Map · Paper Sketching · Prototyping · Usability Testing </p>\n<p>Tools:<br>Sketch · Flinto · Photoshop · InVision · Adobe XD</p>\n<p>Languages:<br>R language, HTML, CSS, PYTHON</p>\n<p><a ref=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingssun/\"> </a></p>\n"}],"Post":[{"title":"Activity App","subtitle":"UX/UI Design, Concept Design","date":"2019-01-02T22:30:13.000Z","cover_image":"../images/activity_app.png","_content":"\nThis was originally a course project. We have noticed that it is very difficult to find activities and hobbies combined in one place and find a place where to practice them. We decided to create a platform where people could easily find information about hobbies and places to practice them. As one member in the team, I was responsible for designing all interfaces.\n\n### Understanding Users\nWe would like to better understand our potential user, especially their needs. In this project we decided to first send out **questionnaires** to determine who we should interview. This choice was based on who we thought would be a potential user, but we also tried to vary the receivers so that we had different demographics. Since we wanted to **interview** about 4 people, we thought that sending the survey to 20 people would be more than enough to find the right candidates.\n\n<img src = \"/images/methods.png\" alt=\"method\" style = \"height: 100px; width: 600px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n<img src = \"/images/user-profile.png\" alt=\"user profile\" style = \"height: 300px; width: 900px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\nThe interview transcripts allowed us to analyse the interview’s data. We started labelling every action, context or any **phrases** or **words** we found to be relevant to our concept. Most of them were actions that described how the tasks were done. But we also noted different contexts, influencers or other interesting thoughts the interviewee might have had.\n\n<img src = \"/images/coding.png\" alt=\"coding\" style = \"height: 500px; width: 750px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n### Scenario \nWe used a scenario to depict what features the app would have and how they would work. Whilst creating the scenario we were able to discuss and plan a  rough version of the app. By drawing upon the codes from the user interviews, we were able to design the beginnings of a suitable user oriented interface for the app. \n\n### From Paper Prototype to Low-fidelity Prototype\nAfter we had gathered all the data from the user studies and also gotten preliminary feedback from our users, we started to make a paper prototype and decide the functions inside. Then we designed a low-fidelity prototype.\n\nThe main features of our application are; search and explore activities, create a profile and connect with other people with the apps’ community platform, where user can create and search sports events and find a teammate to play sports with, as an example. Every application interface is provided in the Appendices as well as the Marvel prototype link. Here are the main application interfaces with the main features.\n\n<img src = \"/images/paper-prototype.png\" alt=\"paper prototype\" style = \"height: 350px; width: 1000px \" class = \"center\"/>\n</br>\n<img src = \"/images/low-fidelity.png\" alt=\"low-fidelity\" style = \"height: 700px; width: 900px \" class = \"center\"/>\n</br>\n<h3> Usability Test </h3>\n\nThrough the test, all of our potential users showed great interest in our application.  Generally, they all indicated that the application is very intuitive, easy to figure out and use for a first time user. Since our application is clear and well-spaced and the interface is well-functioning, it was really quick for them to do all the tasks.\n\nHere is the list of tasks:\n    Task 1: skip the login\n    Task 2: explore the sports\n    Task 3: see your upcoming events (that you are attending)\n    Task 4: find a team to join\n    Task 5: create a new event\n\n### Design and Test High-fidelity Prototype\nWe refined our low fidelity prototype to a high fidelity prototype, so that we could conduct a proper usability test in the usability lab of Haaga-Helia. \n\nThe main layout follows the low-fidelity prototype. But the main color is changed to orange. Because this is an activity app, we would like to convey the idea of energetic and encouragement. The elements in category page and my event page are bigger to ensure users see them immediately.\n\n<img src = \"/images/high-fidelity.png\" alt=\"high-fidelity\" style = \"height: 780px; width: 800px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\nAfter all interfaces ready, we designed 8 tasks for usability testing. Participants were mostly students at Haaga-Helia. They were close to our end users, as they were in our age range, were familiar with hobbies and activities and have knowledge in apps and smartphones, which is what we needed. The entire process was recorded for the following analysis. The usability test indeed reflected two main problems of the design. \n\nThe first main problem is the back button. This is during the ‘look up your events coming up today’ task. When users clicked the ‘back’ button on ‘saved event’ page, there were something wrong with our back buttons. They couldn’t go back to the profile page. This made our users a little bit confused and uncomfortable.\n​\nIn addition, during the ‘Sign up for surfing practice’ task, right after opening the café 1 description, two users were puzzled about closing the café description. They complained about the lack of back buttons and couldn’t figure how to close the popup description. (It is designed to swipe down the description on mobile phones, but we did the usability test on the computer screen.)\n​\nFinally, it seemed that some titles were not as obvious as we thought. The name ‘Community’ seems to be too ambiguous. We also noticed that a user confused ‘today’s events’ with the ‘events’ search page.  It appears to be some confusion with ‘My events’ tab and ‘Saved’, as they seem to mean the same thing to the users.\n\n<img src = \"/images/tester.png\" alt=\"usability test\" style = \"height: 550px; width: 400px \" class = \"center\"/>\n</br>\n\n### Keep Improving User Interfaces\nAfter the course project ended, I keep improving this user interfaces as my own interest. For me, the design never ends. The color, style, layout, font have been changing a lot compared to the original low-fidelity prototype. \n\nThis is the first mobile application I designed, I keep redesigning it to see how much progress I have made so far and make me aware of how rapid the design preferences change over time.\n\nNow the theme is black and red, looks very modern and fashionable. Instead of infinite list, the design of the swipe cards is meant to add enjoyment to the app. Users are able to quickly like and save event they are interested in and ignore those they don't like. Meanwhile, they are still able to find events according to the categories. \n\n<img src = \"/images/activity.png\" alt=\"activity\" style = \"height: 700px; width: 600px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n<div>\n    <button onclick=\"window.location.href = '/index.html';\">Back</button>\n</div>","source":"_posts/activity.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Activity App\nsubtitle: UX/UI Design, Concept Design\ndate: 2019-01-03 00:30:13\ncover_image: ../images/activity_app.png\n---\n\nThis was originally a course project.

With the rapid growth of the company, more and more talents are needed to bring more possibilities. This page is a showcase to display the working environment and company culture.\n\nWith the rapid growth of the company, more and more talents are needed to boost company business and bring more possibilities. Avaus team are constantly looking for fresh blood. Although they post recruitment information through different channels, the result is less than satisfactory. \n\n### Requirements\nIn order to understand their needs and expectations, we had two meetings and interviews with Avaus to retrieve their requirements.\n\nIn general, Avaus hoped the new recruitment page was able to:\n1. Attract more right potential applicants\n2. Let applicants know the business value and business cultures\n3. Let applicants know if they fit in the company/positions\n4. Extend company’s media market\n5. Show the free and relax atmosphere in the company\n6. Welcome young /fresh people with their creative ideas.\n7. Encourage and accept who have the right attitudes even if they are in the wrong environment\n\nSpecifically, they asked us to focus on career hunt webpage, add energetic design, add more about company culture and values.

The data is unreliable and contains loopholes since it is easier and cheaper to obtain a new birth certificate than to apply for a duplicate copy. \n\nThe distance within the rural areas to any of the authorized Regional Offices conducting the registration process, as well as the lack of electricity and data network infrastructure in those areas are facts declining the credibility of current CRV system since people within rural areas are neglecting the registration of death or birth.\n\nThe Namibian Government’s 2030 strategy declined “war-against-poverty” and it explicitly recognizes the birth and death registration process improvement as a step to reduce the poverty. The overall goals of Namibia NDP4 Strategy 2030 have been defined as \n    - high and sustainable economic growth\n    - increased income equality\n    - employment creation\n\nAs a solution to the above problems, we introduce a new value proposition that invites an entrepreneurial mindset by building a new “Namibian Registrar Service Partner Ecosystem” that provide authorized and trusted registrars to handle the registrations of birth and death within the rural areas. This Ecosystem encourages new Startups opportunities that invite entrepreneurship and increase income equality, employment creation and high sustainable economic growth for.\n\n<img src = \"/images/value.png\" alt=\"Value Proposition\" style = \"height: 500px; width: 700px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\nThe value proposition is to create a new partner ecosystem that can execute the registration process of birth and death within the rural areas with the assistance of new technologies like LPWAN, KUHA Mobile Network, and Android App. \n\nThe purpose of this new service is to create opportunities for new entrepreneurs, remove poverty, increase economic growth and help Namibia to transformation towards a more digital society.\n \nThe reason why this solution suggests LPWAN as a complementary component to the KUHA Mobile Network is that it requires less support and less electricity, which therefore can provide a sustainable solution within the rural areas of Namibia.\n\n### KUDU APP\nI was responsible for designing the birth registration flow.\n\n1. Registration process\nThe birth registration process is quite straightforward. Before the registration starts, the registrar will check if the newborn exists. Then, the registrar follows the steps and fill in the form. All the input fields are mandatory to be filled. Importantly, the newborn will get the E-ID after registering the birth successfully.\n\n2. Use case\nThe registrar is the only operator in the birth registration stage. When a Namibian citizen come to the registrar and require to register a baby, the registrar is responsible for filling the birth registration form in the app, inputting the correct information and submitting it successfully.\n\n<img src = \"/images/use-case.png\" alt=\"Essential Use Case\" style = \"height: 400px; width: 500px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\nThe prototypes of birth registration is a series of forms waiting to be filled. Here are the key prototypes in the birth registration process below, along with the detailed description.\n\n1. Landing stepper\nThe landing page of birth registration is a stepper, which displays the whole progress of the registration. It is also the first page the user would be navigated, right after the registrar taps the birth registration from the home page. \n\n    The stepper would show up once the user chose to do the birth registration. It indicates the progress of registration to make sure the user has overview of registration process. There is also a short description of each step to illustrate what the user is going to fill in.\n\n<img src = \"/images/kudu1.png\" alt=\"Stepper\" style = \"height: 450px; width: 520px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n2. Forms\nAs the previous stepper displays, the forms of birth registration are divided into four parts: Details of the child, Birth registration details, biological father information, and biological mother information. Separating a length form into clear sections helps reduce users’ short-term memory and decrease the possibility of overwhelming users. Furthermore, the registrar is able to save the form at each step so as not to lose any important information and do repetitive work. It improves the efficiency of registration and prevents accidental application crash. The headline always indicates the current step. Once the form is completed, the button at the bottom right is available to save the contents and continue to the next step.\n\n<img src = \"/images/kudu2.png\" alt=\"Forms\" style = \"height: 600px; width: 900px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n3. Confirmation and completion\nAs the last part of the form submission, we designed a confirmation step before they officially submit the form. This is to ensure the user double checks all input information. The confirmation page follows the same pattern as the first land page -- stepper, which ensure the consistency of the whole user journey. \n\n    Specifically, as the following prototypes shows, there is an ‘edit’ button available in the end of each form section. We offer a shortcut for users to modify their information on this page. \n\n    After the user verified all information, there will be a pop up dialog window to yield closure. This is to ask user for confirming his action again and also indicate the form will upload formally. There is no chance to change it anymore after this.\n\n    Finally, with a big tick symbol and big size of ‘Congratulations’, this indicates user the completion of the birth registration, which is the last step of the whole progress. What’s more, there is a button of ‘new birth registration’ to give the user a shortcut starting a new registration.

Registration process\nThe birth registration process is quite straightforward. Before the registration starts, the registrar will check if the newborn exists. Then, the registrar follows the steps and fill in the form. All the input fields are mandatory to be filled. Importantly, the newborn will get the E-ID after registering the birth successfully.\n\n2. Use case\nThe registrar is the only operator in the birth registration stage. When a Namibian citizen come to the registrar and require to register a baby, the registrar is responsible for filling the birth registration form in the app, inputting the correct information and submitting it successfully.\n\n<img src = \"/images/use-case.png\" alt=\"Essential Use Case\" style = \"height: 400px; width: 500px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\nThe prototypes of birth registration is a series of forms waiting to be filled. Here are the key prototypes in the birth registration process below, along with the detailed description.\n\n1. Landing stepper\nThe landing page of birth registration is a stepper, which displays the whole progress of the registration. It is also the first page the user would be navigated, right after the registrar taps the birth registration from the home page. \n\n    The stepper would show up once the user chose to do the birth registration. It indicates the progress of registration to make sure the user has overview of registration process. There is also a short description of each step to illustrate what the user is going to fill in.\n\n<img src = \"/images/kudu1.png\" alt=\"Stepper\" style = \"height: 450px; width: 520px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n2. Forms\nAs the previous stepper displays, the forms of birth registration are divided into four parts: Details of the child, Birth registration details, biological father information, and biological mother information. Separating a length form into clear sections helps reduce users’ short-term memory and decrease the possibility of overwhelming users. Furthermore, the registrar is able to save the form at each step so as not to lose any important information and do repetitive work. It improves the efficiency of registration and prevents accidental application crash. The headline always indicates the current step. Once the form is completed, the button at the bottom right is available to save the contents and continue to the next step.\n\n<img src = \"/images/kudu2.png\" alt=\"Forms\" style = \"height: 600px; width: 900px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n3. Confirmation and completion\nAs the last part of the form submission, we designed a confirmation step before they officially submit the form. This is to ensure the user double checks all input information. The confirmation page follows the same pattern as the first land page -- stepper, which ensure the consistency of the whole user journey. \n\n    Specifically, as the following prototypes shows, there is an ‘edit’ button available in the end of each form section.

We chose REDI because it is the newest shopping mall in the Helsinki area. I am mainly responsible for interview, visualization and design.\n\nBefore the project start, we also get the pemission of doing investigation there. The manager also indicated that there were plenty of 'navigation' problems inside the shopping mall, which customers have complained a lot. Because of this, we were more problem-oriented when conducting the investigation. We stay focus on navigating to bus stops.\n\n### Data Collection\nSince I have never been that shopping mall, I first shot a video of navigating myself to the west bus stop with the think aloud protocol. As a novelty, I lost my way and failed to find the bus stop and had no idea where I was. I was completely confused by these guidance signs. They directed me to a place of nowhere. All these obstacles were marked down for the following investigation, which was especailly useful to forming our questions for interviewing.\n\nWith team, we went around inside the building and obeserving customers. It was quite obvious that there were a lot of customers wandering around to find their way, some were even upset. \n\nThen we randomly interviewed several passengers to get insights from them. Seven out of fourteen (7/14) were first time at REDI as well because of the 'reputation' of REDI. They were curious. Some cusomters were disappointed and expressed very negative feelings about failing finding their way. Few customers were satisfied with REDI since it is new and not much people there. Besides, we also interviewed the info desk and four staff. According to their knowledge and own experience, most of staff there commute by metro, so none of these staff we interviewed has any idea of the bus stop location.\n\n<img src = \"/images/redi-1.jpg\" alt=\"Poster\" style = \"height: 600px; width: 420px; float:left; margin: 20px \" class = \"center\"/>\n<img src = \"/images/redi-2.jpg\" alt=\"Poster2\" style = \"height: 600px; width: 420px \" class = \"center\"/>\n\n### User research & Qualitative analysis\nNow, we have a lot of data from obeservation, field study, and interviews.

A lof of info screens, but there is only one info desk. What's more, there is no clear sign directing customers to the info desk.\n\nWhat we recommend to do:\n1. For navigation, we suggest to apply distinguishable light and decorations at different parts of REDI.\n2.
