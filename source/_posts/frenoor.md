Frenoor is a food sharing app, which allows everybody, no matter their cooking skills, have a taste of healthy homemade meal.

Frenoor makes home cooking as a business. It provides benefits for both sides, people who love cooking, and people who are too busy to cook. It is affordable and local. 

The app is designed to be simple and intuitive for most of users. With least clicks, they could get all the information they would like to know and order their desired homemade meals.

The main colour chosen for this app is orange. Obviously, it conveys 'warm'. Grey and white are used to balance orange. And green is for contrast. Meanwhile, it indicates healthy as well.

### The Logo
For designing this logo, I have come up many ideas. Since our app is orignated from spreading love by home cooking. I tried combining little cute hearts with kitchen related symbols such as fork and knief, plot, pan, and so forth.

Finally, our team tended to favor the pan with heart. Thus, I developed the initial simiple pan to a pan house which can also pop out cute little hearts. These hearts also relate to wisps of smoke in the real life. In brief, this symbol perfectly combined two key words, love and home cooking together.
