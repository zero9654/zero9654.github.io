### Brief Introduction
[Avaus](https://www.avaus.fi/en/) is a innovative marketing company. With the rapid growth of the company, more and more talents are needed to bring more possibilities. This page is a showcase to display the working environment and company culture.

With the rapid growth of the company, more and more talents are needed to boost company business and bring more possibilities. Avaus team are constantly looking for fresh blood. Although they post recruitment information through different channels, the result is less than satisfactory. 

### Requirements
In order to understand their needs and expectations, we had two meetings and interviews with Avaus to retrieve their requirements.

In general, Avaus hoped the new recruitment page was able to:
1. Attract more right potential applicants
2. Let applicants know the business value and business cultures
3. Let applicants know if they fit in the company/positions
4. Extend company’s media market
5. Show the free and relax atmosphere in the company
6. Welcome young /fresh people with their creative ideas.
7. Encourage and accept who have the right attitudes even if they are in the wrong environment

Specifically, they asked us to focus on career hunt webpage, add energetic design, add more about company culture and values. They expeted a simple and neat design.

The new [Avaus Career Page](https://lingssun.wixsite.com/test) largely follows the style of Avaus official website, by using the same colour scheme and similar fonts. More importantly, the new career page displays a clear hiearchy.

The idea of this new career page is to simplify the job hunting steps and enrich the contents related to company culture and values. Thus, as you can see in the design, a objective-oriented user is able to search the job directly in the job searching field by simply typing in key words. The search field is placed on the top of the page and appears immediately when a user land in the page. On the other side, a user is also free to check all available jobs out and get to know the company on this page. It is not only a recruitment page, but also a showcase room for Avaus. They could take advantage of it and market themselves.
