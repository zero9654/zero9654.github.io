This was originally a course project. We have noticed that it is very difficult to find activities and hobbies combined in one place and find a place where to practice them. We decided to create a platform where people could easily find information about hobbies and places to practice them. As one member in the team, I was responsible for designing all interfaces.

Since this is the fist mobile application I designed, I keep updating it to see how much progress I have made so far.

Now the theme is black and red, looks very modern and fashionable. Instead of infinite list, the design of the swipe cards is meant to add enjoyment to  the app.
