This project is to design a learning system for human factor in design course. The course consists of fact-to-face lectures, individual assignments, and project assignments.  

The new page applys the same colour style as Haaga-Helia's official website. Blue and green bring calmness, while pink adds energy to the page. We hope all students process fluently without any cognitive load with a clear structure of a course page. So, when our team starts forming the initial concept, gestalt principles and perceptual learning are taken into account. Our goal is to influence students current study behaviours.

**The visualisation of the progress** information is designed to make student realise how much they have achieved in this course so as to motivate them complete the course. As long as they see what they have done, a sense of achievement would nudge them to complete it. That's why here we choose the vivid pink colour for not only attracting attentions, but also stimulating students. 

Aside from all above, we suggest that the lecturer provides only the most important, the most relevant and the most needed information. More short videos and interviews should be introduced into the course. What's more, structure all learning materials logically to reduce learning time and increase learning capability and understanding.
